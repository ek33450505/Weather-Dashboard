# Weather Dashboard

## Description 
The purpose of this project was to test my new skills using Server-Side APIs by utilizing the OpenWeather Map APIs. 

User Story:
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
